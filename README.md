# StudyBot x Streamlit

âœ¨ Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. Create beautiful data apps in hours, not weeks. All in pure Python. âœ¨

## Installation

```bash```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Start development server

> If you're using the default template, **remember to set the OpenAI API key** in `main.py`.

Run the following command:

```bash
cd StudybotAPI
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Now go to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and start chatting with your bot! The bot will automatically reload when you change the code.

## Motive
When studying a theoretical subject, which has a lot of concepts, dates, important events etc. No matter how hard we try to momrize them, its hard to remember them all. So, I thought of making a bot which can help us in quick revision of the subject. For example, if we are studying history, and we forget the event of 1857 revolt, we can ask the bot like **"What happened in 1857?"** and it will tell us brief answer. This will help us in quick revision of the subject.

## How to use
Input the prompt in the text box and press enter. The bot will give you the answer. If you want to ask another question, just enter the question and the bot will try to answer.
